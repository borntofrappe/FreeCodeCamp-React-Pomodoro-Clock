_Notice_

The application is currently being developed with the `create-react-app` utility. It will be published on CodePen with most of its functionalities, hopefully soon.

## Preface

For the penultimate project allowing me to earn the **Fron End Libraries** certification @freeCodeCamp, the task at hand is the creation of a pomodoro clock.

A simple, single page application similar to [this one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/XpKrrW).

Just as I mentioned for the other projects developed for the current certification, meaning the [random quote machine](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/yqXOXG) and the [functioning calculator](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/OwxKEY), I have already built such an application [before](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/PeKwOW/). That time however, I did not use any external libraries, like **React.js**. To properly earn the **Fron End Libraries** certification I therefore decided to re-write my previous project with the library's inclusion.

I reckon only now how the re-write is not only a good pretext to practice with **React.js**, but with JavaScript as a whole.

## Design

As I did not want to replicate the same layout and overall look of the [previous application](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/PeKwOW/), I spent an entire coding session to create a new design for the application. You can find the result [right here](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/LBeMdy). 

While I am not completely satisfied with the color palette chosen for the UI, I am quite proud of the layout of the different sections. I am also quite excited to tinker with a functioning project altering the appearance of the `.visuals__hourglass` container, visually relaying the amount of time left in each session.

Perhaps I went a little overboard with the size of the buttons to start/pause/reset the pomodoro clock, but that is something I am going to modify at a later stage. For quite large screen viewports, the sizes work fine, but there is a range in which they are overwhelming on the eye. Something to remember.

With the given UI, the project is ported to a React application using the `create-react-app` utility.
